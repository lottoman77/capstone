Summary:
This week we each worked to further complete Unity learning modules. 

Goals completed:
A VR feature (such as 360 Photosphere and modeling) has been implemented by a majority of the group using Tutorial modules.

Challenges faced:
Many, if not all, of us have been busy studying for midterms and completing lab assignments for other classes.

Goals for next week:
Get further in the unity modules and create something more suited to our project.
Work on getting a clearer picture of the project so we can begin thinking about how we can divide up the work
