Summary:
This week our primary goal was to get in contact with Professor Hector
to set up a meeting/discussion so we could learn about what we
were expected to do for this project.

Goals completed:
Set up a meeting time with professor Hector Munoz-Avilar
The meeting will take place Tuesday Feb 25th, at 1:00 PM

Goals not completed:
We have yet to fully understand what type of work would be needed for this project. 
However, we plan to learn that in the meeting.

Challenges faced:
Finding a meeting time that majority, if not all, of the team could make.

Goals for next week:
Meet with Professor Hector.
Begin understanding what kind of work our project demands
this includes the technologies we'd need to learn and time it would take.
